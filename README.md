# Project

This repo is for folks interested in growing and strengthening the communities in our repos. We're thinking about this in five categories:

* **Responsiveness** Issues and questions get prompt replies, pull requests make progress and are merged in a reasonable time.
* **Productivity** It's easy to get started contributing a code change -- easy to build, to navigate the code, debug a change and test it.
* **Transparency** Everyone in the repo community has insight into and influence over planning and prioritization for the project.
* **Inclusiveness** The repo is welcoming. Everyone feels part of one team, and it's safe for everyone.
* **Approachability** It doesn't matter what level of experience you have, everyone's included. Nobody should be afraid of asking a question or offering a pull request.

At the moment our focus is on a set repos relating to developer tools and platforms, including C++, Python, .NET including Xamarin and NuGet, and Typescript. (You may have seen some surveys we did last year in those repos, which helped motivate this effort.) Nothing here is specific to those repos - it's just they're the repos in which some of us work. 

We're using issues in this repo an on our [project board](https://github.com/microsoft/contributor-community-experiments/projects/1) to track our experiments. Our goal is to identify best practices that we can share amongst our repos. We expect we have plenty we can learn from healthy OSS communities of all kinds.

We welcome contributions and ideas from anyone.
